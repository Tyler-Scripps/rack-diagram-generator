# rack-diagram-generator
Generates a diagram of a rack from a JSON file

Includes three files:
1. HTML file that is the basic webpage
2. JS file for handling drawing of rack on canvas
3. JS file for handling styling of the webpage

The python folder is a deprecated version written in python that creates svg files but the format for the JSON files has changed so the python won't work with the test JSON and has few features
